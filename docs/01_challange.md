Hotel Challenge
All the big hotel platforms are working on deeper integrations of agent processes and
booking, the idea that an assistant will take care of your travel schedule has risen over the last
years and we think that ai agents will participate as such an agent. We want to explore how
practical guidance can become practical action: How will AI Agents become assistants of
booking hotel services.
Currently the buzzword MCP is floating around and we would like you to explore this topic for
hotel bookings in our challenge.
Challenge:
1. How will AI Agents be able to book hotels in the future? Will MCP be the protocol to do
so?
2. How should a tourism area and hotels prepare themselves when an ai agent is
responsible for the booking of overnight stays.
3. How can we ensure trust and reliability in bookings made by AI agents?
